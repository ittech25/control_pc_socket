# control_pc_socket
this is just little application of socket programming
this repository consists of three files:
1. client.py : if you want to help someone who is faraway from you, then to control his pc , this file should run at his pc. after you run server.py file or server_for_multiclient.py on your pc.
2. server.py : you have to put this file on server so that you could connect with your friend , then you have to run this file, after this client will run client.py file
3. server_for_multiclient.py : this is same as server.py , only difference is: if you run this instead of server.py then you can control more than one pc at the same time, this file uses one concept of multithreading.
